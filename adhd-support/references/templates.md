# Templates — Reusable Templates

Templates the agent can use, adapt, or fill in together with the user.

---

## 1. Brain Dump

For Dump Mode or as Step 1 of Planning Mode.

```
🧠 BRAIN DUMP — [date]
Timer: 5 minutes. Just get it out, don't organize.

Everything in my head right now:
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 

(keep going until the timer rings or nothing's left)

---
Now categorize:
🔴 Urgent and concrete: 
🟡 Important but not urgent: 
🔵 Mental noise: 
⚪ Not mine / Can't control: 
```

---

## 2. The 3 Things of the Day

For Planning Mode. The complete daily plan.

```
📋 MY 3 THINGS — [date]

1. 🎯 THE Thing (if I only do one thing today, this is it):
   → What is it? 
   → First micro-step? 
   → When am I doing it? 
   → How long does it take? (estimate × 3 = )

2. ✅ Would Be Nice:
   → What is it? 
   → First micro-step? 

3. 🚀 If I'm On Fire:
   → What is it? 

---
⚡ My peak energy today is probably: [morning/afternoon/evening]
🎵 What I'm putting on in the background: 
🛡️ Distractions I'm going to block: 
```

---

## 3. ADHD-Friendly Time Blocking

For Planning Mode when they want to structure the day.

```
⏰ MY DAY — [date]
(Buffers are non-negotiable)

MORNING (peak energy)
├── [time] - THE Thing
│   Starting micro-step: 
│   Estimated duration (×3): 
├── [time] - ☕ BUFFER (15 min: water, bathroom, move around)
├── [time] - Would Be Nice / Meetings
│
MIDDAY (low energy — don't fight it)
├── [time] - Actual lunch (not a working lunch)
├── [time] - Low-effort tasks:
│   □ 
│   □ 
│   □ 
│
AFTERNOON (second wind if it comes)
├── [time] - Collaborative work / variety
├── [time] - ☕ BUFFER
├── [time] - 🔒 SHUTDOWN (see ritual below)
```

---

## 4. Task Decomposition

For Focus Mode. Breaking an overwhelming task into micro-steps.

```
🎯 TASK: [task name]

The full task feels like a 😰 [1-10]: 

Now let's break it down:

Step 1 (the micro-step — so small it's almost silly):
→ 

Step 2 (if step 1 went well):
→ 

Step 3:
→ 

Step 4:
→ 

(maximum 5-6 visible steps at a time — more is overwhelming)

---
🎵 Temptation bundle: I'm combining this with: 
⏱️ Timer: minutes of work, minutes of rest
👥 Body double: [alone / with someone / Focusmate]
```

---

## 5. Weekly Review

For Reflection Mode at the end of the week.

```
💭 WEEKLY REVIEW — Week of [date]

🎉 What I DID accomplish (everything counts):
- 
- 
- 
- 

📊 Patterns I noticed:
- Best time of day: 
- Worst time of day: 
- What flowed effortlessly: 
- What was hardest: 
- Surprise of the week: 

🔧 ONE single adjustment for next week:
→ 

💬 One thing I want to say to myself:
→ 
```

---

## 6. Shutdown Ritual

For the end of Reflection Mode or at the end of the day.

```
🔒 SHUTDOWN — [date]

□ Write tomorrow's THE Thing: 
□ Check tomorrow's calendar (any surprises?): 
□ Clean ONE small thing from desk/inbox: 
□ Say out loud: "Work is done for today."
□ Physical transition: [close laptop / leave the room / change clothes]

Emotional state at close: 
Note to my tomorrow self: 
```

---

## 7. When-Then Cards

For Transition Mode. Create rules that eliminate the need to decide.

```
🔄 MY WHEN-THENS

When [trigger] → then [action]

Examples to adapt:
- When I finish my coffee → I open my work document
- When the timer goes off → I save and stand up for 2 minutes
- When I leave a meeting → I write 3 notes before doing anything else
- When I feel like I can't go on → permission to stop for 15 minutes
- When I open my phone for no reason → I put it face down and drink water

My when-thens for today:
1. When → then 
2. When → then 
3. When → then 
```

## Notes for the Agent

- Templates are starting points. ALWAYS adapt them to the user's context
- Don't present the full template without context — fill it in together
- If the user gets overwhelmed by the template itself → simplify: "Forget the template. What's THE thing today?"
- Emojis are optional — some find them helpful, others find them distracting
- Never insist on completing all fields — "whatever comes out is fine"
